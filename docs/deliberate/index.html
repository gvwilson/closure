<h1>Deliberate Closure</h1>
<p class="subtitle">when you have time to correct course</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore this first because it is less traumatic than the alternative</li>
<li>And because recommendations are things the project should be doing anyway</li>
<li>The most important assumption is that
    <em>you have time to make changes to the project as part of shutting it down</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Governance</h2>
<ul>
<li>People often conflate teams with projects<ul>
<li>But team may disband when the project completes, or take on another project</li>
<li>And membership of team may change during project</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Every team should have explicit rules for making decisions<ul>
<li>E.g., <a href="../glossary/#bdfl">BDFL</a> or <a href="../glossary/#marthas-rules">Martha's Rules</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Every team also needs explicit rules for deciding <a href="../glossary/#suffrage">suffrage</a><ul>
<li>"Being consulted" is meaningless without further stipulation</li>
<li>"Who must agree in order for this to happen?"</li>
<li>"Who can veto proposals?"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Growing number of open source projects have a <code>GOVERNANCE.md</code> file in their repository<ul>
<li>But very few of these include explicit shutdown criteria</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Put this in place <em>before</em> discussion of endings<ul>
<li>It's hard enough to decide under normal circumstances</li>
<li>Harder still when also thinking about shutdown</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Example: the <a href="https://apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a> (ASF)<ul>
<li>Board can request a roll call</li>
<li>At least three people must respond to a "do a release" email for the project to be considered viable</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<section class="exercise">
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Who is currently a member of your project?
    How do you know?
    How do they (and others) know?
    What does being a member actually mean?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does someone stop being a member, either voluntarily or otherwise?</p>
</li>
</ol>
</section>
<h2>Assets and Obligations</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can't manage things you aren't aware of</li>
<li>Every project has <a href="../glossary/#asset">assets</a> that have some sort of value to someone<ul>
<li>Source code in a repository</li>
<li>Discussion archives that explain decision making (especially valuable to genAI)</li>
<li>A website and/or social media accounts</li>
<li>Software licenses</li>
<li>Hardware</li>
<li>Name recognition (possibly even a trademark)</li>
<li>Community goodwill</li>
<li><a href="../glossary/#collective-understanding">Collective understanding</a> [<a href="../bibliography/#Baetjer1997">Baetjer1997</a>]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Project may also have <a href="../glossary/#obligation">obligations</a><ul>
<li>Hosting charges</li>
<li>Software licenses</li>
<li>A bank account</li>
<li>Partially-completed research contracts or upcoming software releases</li>
<li>Reports to funding agencies</li>
<li>Security of confidential data</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You may have legal responsibilities around both<ul>
<li>E.g., institution may require you to return lab equipment</li>
<li>Or require you to make best effort to realize full commercial value</li>
<li><em>Ask someone</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You must also think about self-defence<ul>
<li>Having a gambling company take over your domain is unpleasant</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<section class="exercise">
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Make a list of the things that belong to your project.
    Compare it with the lists made by other project members:
    what did they include that you didn't and vice versa?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine your project was going to shut down in three months.
    What would you have to deliver, to whom, in that time?</p>
</li>
</ol>
</section>
<h2>Permissions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Permissions are the overlap of governance with assets and obligations<ul>
<li>Who can do what, with what</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Easiest to use personal accounts for everything<ul>
<li>Particularly in a project's early days when you're not sure it's going anywhere</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As soon as multiple people can do things that outsiders cannot,
    use dedicated accounts rather than personal ones<ul>
<li>Enables continuity if (when) people move or are unavailable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And <em>make a list</em> of what those special actions are<ul>
<li>Keep it somewhere findable (e.g., <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> in a project repository)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use a <a href="../glossary/#password-manager">password manager</a> for all organizational accounts<ul>
<li>Actually, use one for your own work as well [<a href="../bibliography/#Small2021">Small2021</a>]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<section class="exercise">
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What is your project not able to do if you are unavailable for an extended period?
    (For example, "cannot revise a paper" or "cannot publish a new version of a package".)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which of your project's activities are associated with personal accounts (yours or others)
    rather than accounts dedicated to the project?</p>
</li>
</ol>
</section>
<h2>Community</h2>
<ul>
<li>You may want to stay in touch with some or all of the team after the project ends<ul>
<li>"May" and "some" because not every project ends happily</li>
<li>Even if it doesn't, it's useful to maintain good relations with funders, reviewers, customers, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shutdown is often contentious:
    people who have complained but never contributed may criticize you<ul>
<li>Can help to phrase shutdown notice as "putting into hibernation"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Take inspiration from the ASF's procedure<ul>
<li>Don't start by announcing shutdown</li>
<li>Instead, announce that you (singular or plural) are going to stop work
    and ask for volunteers to take over</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="callout">
<p>Do <em>not</em> accept people you don't already know as successors on your project:
there is a small but growing risk that they will try to use it
for <a href="../glossary/#supply-chain-attack">supply chain attacks</a>,
or repurpose your site to advertise gambling, porn, or extremist politics.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>If you are not going to keep the project's domain,
    move the content to a free hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages)
    and put redirects in place</li>
<li>Make sure vendors, donors, and others with a legally binding stake in the project
    have a way to contact you and/or the team after the project's email addresses are shut off</li>
<li>Tell your team and your community as much as you can as soon as you can<ul>
<li>Knowing that a project is shutting down will inevitably affect morale</li>
<li>Don't add uncertainty or rumors to the mix</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Things to tell them:<ul>
<li>Reasons (as much as you can)</li>
<li>Timelines (and updates to timelines, because these always shift)</li>
<li>What's happening to assets and obligations</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>What You Can Skip</h2>
<ul>
<li>The introduction explained that "document everything" doesn't work in practice because:<ul>
<li>People are always too busy to keep the documentation up to date</li>
<li>It's hard to know which bits are actually going to be useful in the future
    (but experience teaches that most aren't)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Force yourself to make an exception for governance, assets &amp; obligations, and permissions<ul>
<li>The project will grind to a halt without these</li>
<li>And there may be legal or reputational risks to not doing it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But if you're shutting the project down, it's OK not to put effort into:<ul>
<li>User-oriented documentation (e.g., tutorials)</li>
<li>Project dependencies</li>
<li>More tests or examples</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hold a Wake</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you have time, it's worth doing a team retrospective<ul>
<li>What did we do well?</li>
<li>What could we have done differently?</li>
<li>What did we learn along the way?</li>
<li>What are we going to remember?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The last of these may be the most important<ul>
<li>Endings are sad, but they can be sweetened</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="callout">
<p><a href="https://exple.tive.org/blarg/2025/11/11/historical-reasons-2/">Mike Hoye suggested</a> that
we should retire the account names of Unix greats
in the way that sports teams retire jersey numbers,
and for the same reasons.
End-of-project t-shirts or laptop stickers
are another great way to say,
"We were here and we did something good,"
and so is getting the whole team on a call
to watch as you push the "archive" button on your repository.</p>
